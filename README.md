# Multiplayer-Action-Platformer (Unity/c#)

Here you can find the src of my game. Game looks like a small platformer :) . I'm working on the multiplayer now, it's working but not so good.

If you want to see what the multiplayer is, so you can see the Master branch 
<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/Pepsi4/Multiplayer-Action-Platformer" data-icon="octicon-eye" data-size="large" aria-label="Watch ntkme/github-buttons on GitHub">*here*</a>. (I messed up it pretty well, it should be rewritten)

Or if you want to see the stable singleplayer version, you can do it
<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/Pepsi4/Multiplayer-Action-Platformer/tree/SinglePlayer-v2.0" data-icon="octicon-eye" data-size="large" aria-label="Watch ntkme/github-buttons on GitHub">*here*</a>. (I already changed singleplayer on the Master branch so it will be better :d )
